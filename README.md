# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Step 1:
    I went through the website making sure everything worked the way that it should. The search engine optimization button did not lead the the search engine optimization section at the bottom of the page as it did with online reputation managment and social media marketing.
Step 2:
    In the CSS file there were multiple classes that had the exact same parameters, so i created one class with those parameters and replaced their references in the html file.
    There were two class that could be merged into one benefits and benefit as well as all the classes branching off from benefit being merged together.
Step 3:
    Reorganizing the css file so that the classes were in the order that they appear in the HTML file.
Step 4:
     Adding Comments so that a user can easily figure out what parts of the HTML file point to which points on the website.
